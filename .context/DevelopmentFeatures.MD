# Development Features

These are the features for the development in the feature.

## Micro-interactions:

*   **Idea:** Add smooth transitions when sections come into view as the user scrolls. Framer Motion is excellent for this. For each transition it should have special appearing effect. For "The Spark" it should be microsparks in the style of current application. 


## Project Section Enhancements:

*   **Idea:** When the user hovers over a project card, display a short, animated overlay with more details (e.g., technologies used, a brief description).
*   **Idea:** Use a more visually appealing layout for the project cards. Consider a staggered grid or a carousel if you have many projects.

## "Connect With Me" Section:

*   **Idea:** Add a contact form.
*   **Idea:** Add my email button and it will redirrect to write email mamatovviacheslav@gmail.com
